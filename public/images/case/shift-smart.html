        <h2>Revolutionizing Worker Scheduling</h2>
        <p>ShiftSmart is a dynamic platform designed to optimize workforce scheduling by replacing inefficient manual processes with an automated, intelligent system.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>ShiftSmart is a workforce scheduling application that enables companies to efficiently assign workers to shifts, track availability, and manage work sites. The system streamlines scheduling, eliminating reliance on Excel sheets and phone calls.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>Our vision is to build a scalable and user-friendly workforce scheduling system that ensures real-time worker availability, reduces scheduling conflicts, and improves operational efficiency for businesses.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Wireframes & Mockups</h2>
        <p>The initial wireframes were created in Figma, focusing on simplicity and efficiency. Key screens include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dashboard with real-time scheduling updates.</li>
            <li>Worker availability input page.</li>
            <li>Shift assignment interface.</li>
        </ul>
